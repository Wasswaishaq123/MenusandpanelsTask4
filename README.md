 #### **4. User Information:** 
 Displays user information and allows for updates.

 #### **5. Settings:** 
 Provides options to change themes, passwords, and switch users.

 ## **Features and Functional Workflow**

* SIM Card Registration
* SIM Card Deregistration
* User Information Management
* Theme Customization
* User Authentication

##  **Technology Stack**

* **Languages and Frameworks:** Java (Core Java, Swing for GUI)
* **Development Tools:** IntelliJ IDEA (IDE)


## **User Workflow**

**1.** User logs in and is directed to the Home screen.

**2.** User selects a service provider and proceeds to register or deregister a SIM card.

**3.** User can view and update information in the User panel.

## **Development Process** 

* **Implementation Details:**
    * The `AppTheme` class manages the theme across all panels.
    * Each panel is implemented as a separate class.
    * Event listeners handle user interactions.
* **Code Organization:**
    * `AppUI`: Contains UI-related classes.
    * `AppLogic`: Contains the `AppTheme` class.
* **Third-party Libraries/Integrations:** None.

## **Interface Design**

* **UI Elements:** Uses Swing components (JPanel, JLabel, JButton, JTextField, JComboBox). Layout managed using BorderLayout and FlowLayout.

## **Challenges and Resolutions** 

* **Development Challenges:**
    * Managing theme consistency.
    * Handling user input validation.
* **Solutions Implemented:**
    * `AppTheme` class for global theme management.
    * `JOptionPane` for input validation feedback.

## **Future Enhancements** 

* **Potential Improvements:**
    * Database integration for persistent data storage.
    * Advanced theme customization.
    * Multiple language support.
* **Scalability Plans:** Add more modules for additional functionalities (e.g., SIM card tracking, reporting).
